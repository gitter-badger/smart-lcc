# Errata

## Rev A

* Aux RX and TX should be flipped
* Add Zeners to RX, and diodes to TX (primary and auxilliary) to protect those ports from burning out accidentally

## Rev B

* Push button pads aren't ideal for properly sized push buttons. It still works though, soo if this is the only issue, there will not be a Rev C.
