## Manufacturing notes

This revision has been manufactured (including SMT Assembly) with JLCPCB with good results.

The BOM does not include all necessary components. In addition to the BOM, you also need the following:

* An Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect without headers (ABX00052)
* An OLED display. Tested displays include the following, but others with the same pinout likely work:

* Push buttons. The board is designed for the below, but they are a smidge too short and require a small shim. 5 mm tall on the other hand is too tall. 4.3 mm works fine, but presumably 4 mm tall would be ideal.

* A connector, either a regular 2.54 mm 1x06 pin header or, preferrably, a 6 pin TE Connectivity AMPMODU MOD II male header.
